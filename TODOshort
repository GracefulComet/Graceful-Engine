This is a file that use to help me focus on short term goals with the project



1. GameObject. Animation Frames Stored with an array of ( Collum , Row) structs

2. Store in a file? for a series of animations to be used later?

3. Frames: LocX, LocY, SizeX , SizeY , TextureID;
maybe Put this functionality in TexL?

SetCol
SetRow
